Fork from https://github.com/southbridgeio/redmine_recurring_tasks

# Installation

* Ruby 2.2+
* Redmine 3.3+
* Standard plugin installation:

```
cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
git clone https://github.com/troylab/redmine_recurring_tasks.git plugins/redmine_recurring_tasks
bundle install
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
```

# Usage

To use the plugin, you should turn on it in project modules settings. Then you need to go at issue page and you will see
Schedule section with "Add" link, which leads you to recurring settings.

# Run

To run scheduling task you should run rake task

```
cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
bundle exec rake redmine_recurring_tasks:exec RAILS_ENV=production
```

And to do it periodically you may use cron or another external scheduler.

## Schedulers

### Sidekiq-cron

To run sidekiq-cron tasks you should:

- Install redis (*yum install redis*)
- Install plugin [redmine_sidekiq](https://github.com/ogom/redmine_sidekiq)
- Then you can add initialization file. For example

```
# /opt/redmine/config/initializers/zz-cron.rb

class RecurringTaskWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def perform
    checker = RedmineRecurringTasks::IssueChecker.new(Setting.plugin_redmine_recurring_tasks)
    checker.call
  end
end

cron_job_array = [
  {
    'name'  => 'Weekly schedule worker',
    'class' => 'RecurringTaskWorker',
    'cron'  => '*/5 * * * *'
  }
]

Sidekiq::Cron::Job.load_from_array cron_job_array
```

### Whenever

```
cd {REDMINE_ROOT}
whenever --update-crontab --load-file plugins/redmine_recurring_tasks/config/schedule.rb
```

### Cron manual

```
$ crontab -e
```

And add cron job line

```
*/5 * * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/redmine && RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake redmine_recurring_tasks:exec'
```

# Settings

If you have any plugins, which for some reason doesn't copying in spawned issues, you can set specific issue associations fields in plugin settings. But be careful â€” this option can break work plugin scheduler.

For example, if you using plugin *Redmine checklists*, you can check "checklists" in RedmineRecurringTasks settings.
